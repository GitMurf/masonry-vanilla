# masonry-vanilla

This theme applies the Masonry layout to a Vanilla / Plain Roam Graph (i.e., no other CSS).

## How to Install

Simply add a CSS code block onto your roam/css page and copy the following into it (you can choose whether to include Optional-2 and 3):

```
/* MAIN CSS - Required */
@import url('https://abhayprasanna.github.io/dark-age-dracula.css');

/* OPTIONAL 1 - Some additional options on top of Vanilla that Murf uses */


/* OPTIONAL 2 - More customized formatting to Murf's liking (still Roam Vanilla base though) */

```
